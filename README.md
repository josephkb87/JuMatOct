# This JuMatOct Repo 
----------------------------
Covers Matlab and Octave in Jupyter Notebook Basics
JupyterLab is the latest web-based interactive development environment for notebooks, code, and data. Its flexible interface allows users to configure and arrange workflows in data science, scientific computing, computational journalism, and machine learning

This Repo IS NOT a Python_SQL Repo, for the one that has worked examples go to the [Python_SQL](https://github.com/josephkb87/PySQLDB) 

This Repo IS NOT a Python_Matlab Repo, for the one that has worked examples go to the [PythonMATLAB](https://github.com/josephkb87/Matlab_Octave) 

This repo looks at the basics on using Python with Octave Using Jupyter Notebooks sa pythoDB,
Octave is a less heavy to learn and faster learning and coding curve), CLI and GUI interface that us similar to Matlab in function and usage.
