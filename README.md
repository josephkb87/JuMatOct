#   JuMatOct Repo, 

### JupyterLab is the latest web-based interactive development environment for notebooks, code, and data. 
### Its flexible interface allows users to configure and arrange workflows in data science, scientific computing, computational journalism, and machine learning.
___
####  In This Repo,We cover the Basics of Python with Matlab and Octave in Jupyter Notebooks.

#### Octave is a less heavy to learn and faster learning and coding curve), CLI and GUI interface that us similar to Matlab in function and usage.
