Hi, ðŸ‘‹. Welcome.

  GNU OctaveÂ is aÂ scientific programming languageÂ forÂ scientific computingÂ andÂ numerical computation. Octave helps in solving linear and nonlinear problems numerically, and for performing other numerical experiments using a language that is mostly compatible withÂ MATLAB. It may also be used as aÂ batch-orientedÂ language. As part of theÂ GNU Project, it isÂ free softwareÂ under the terms of theÂ GNU General Public License.

MATLABÂ (an abbreviation of "MATrix LABoratory" is aÂ proprietaryÂ multi-paradigmÂ programming languageÂ andÂ numeric computingÂ environment developed byÂ MathWorks. MATLAB allowsÂ matrixÂ manipulations, plotting ofÂ functionsÂ and data, implementation ofÂ algorithms, creation ofÂ user interfaces, and interfacing with programs written in other languages. In this, Matlab_Octave(which is similar to Matlab in function and usage), repository, we will cover the Basics on Matlab Operations Using Octave, a CLI and GUI interface.

#### Requirements.

- Install Octave on Windows/Linux/Mac
[Install octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/download). OR [Get it here](http://www.octave.org).

- [Install VSCode](https://github.com/vscodium/vscodium/releases) or similar IDE on Windows/Linux/Mac.

-------------------------
#### we will look;

* Basic Commands in MATLAB
  
* Flow Control Statements in MATLAB(if_else while, for)
  
* Math Functions(Trigonometric, Exponential, Complex, Rounding and remainder, Specialized math functions,Number theoretic functions, Coordinate transforms
  
* Plots in MATLAB(Basic Plots and Graphs,axis, grid, bar,legending, titleing, xlabel, ylabel, zlabel,xlim, ylim, zlim, stem, subplot, Hold)

* Matrix arithmetic operations and array arithmetic operations.  

* Basic Operations on Electrical, Magnetic and ElectroMagnetc Circuits in Matlab.

* Transformers circuits.

* Types of Signals and Operations.

* advanced problems with matlab.

* Some mathematical problems with matlab.
